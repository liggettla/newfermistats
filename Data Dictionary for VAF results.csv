Column Header,Description
location,Base pair location
mean,average VAF for the set of background samples
SD,VAF standard deviation for the set of background samples
tStat,t statistic for a one sided one sample t-test comparing the average VAF in the background samples to 0
df,degrees of freedom used for the one-sided one sample t-test
pval,uncorrected pvalue for a one sided one sample t-test comparing the average VAF in the background samples to 0
site,sample site
Var,Variant
WT,Wild type
LBonPI,lower bonferroni corrected prediction interval (lower limit set to 0 since negative VAF not possible).
UBonPI,upper bonferroni corrected prediction interval
Chrom,chromosome location
VAF,"Variant allele frequency for a patient (i.e., experimental sample)"
ID,Sample ID number
sigVAF,Indicator for whether the VAF is above the upper bonferroni corrected prediction interval
alpha,Alpha used to create the prediction interval
numTests,number of tests run that were corrected for using bonferroni correction
